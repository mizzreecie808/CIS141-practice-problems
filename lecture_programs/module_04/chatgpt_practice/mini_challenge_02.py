# If the total is over $100, they get 10% off
# If they are a member, they get 5% extra off
# If they are over 60, they get another 5% off
# Discounts stack, and are applied in order:
# Amount over $100 â†’ 10% off
# If member â†’ another 5% off
# If age > 60 â†’ another 5% off
# total = 120.0
# member = "yes"
# age = 65
# answer = 97.47
