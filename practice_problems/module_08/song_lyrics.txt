I got chills, they're multiplying
And I'm losing control
'Cause the power you're supplying
It's electrifying (electrifying)
You better shape up
'Cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you
You better shape up
You better understand
To my heart I must be true
Nothin' left, nothin' left for me to do
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The one I need (the one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (yes, indeed)
If you're filled with affection
You're too shy to convey
Meditate in my direction
Feel your way
I better shape up
'Cause you need a man
I need a man
Who can keep me satisfied
I better shape up
If I'm gonna prove
You better prove
That my faith is justified
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure down deep inside
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The one I need (the one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (yes, indeed)
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh ooh, ooh
The one I need (the one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (yes, indeed) ooh, ooh
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The one I need (the one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (yes, indeed)
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey
The one that I want
