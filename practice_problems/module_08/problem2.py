# Module 08 - Problem #2
#Write a Python program that allows users to log their hiking trips.
# - Use a while loop to repeatedly ask for a hike name and distance in miles
# - Save each entry to hiking_log.txt (each hike on a new line)
# - When the user presses 0, exit the loop & print contents of hiking_log.txt
